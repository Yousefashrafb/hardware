        <p>The GPU, or graphics processing unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle graphics rendering and image processing tasks. It is commonly used in computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices to generate images and animations for display on screens.</p>
        <p>Modern GPUs are highly parallelized processors with hundreds or thousands of cores, allowing them to perform complex calculations required for real-time rendering of 3D graphics and high-definition video playback.</p>
        <p>Key factors to consider when choosing a GPU include graphics memory (VRAM), core count, clock speed, and compatibility with the motherboard and other hardware components.</p>
