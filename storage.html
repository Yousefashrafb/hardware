        <p>Storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs), are used to store data permanently on the computer. They provide non-volatile memory, meaning data is retained even when the power is turned off.</p>
        <p>Hard disk drives use spinning magnetic disks to store data, while solid-state drives use flash memory for faster read and write speeds. The choice between HDDs and SSDs depends on factors like performance, capacity, and cost.</p>
        <p>Key factors to consider when choosing storage include capacity, speed, reliability, and form factor.</p>
